HappyFunTimes.net
=================

This is the rendezvous server for happyfuntimes. You can use it to run your own rendezvous server.

All it does redirects players to their local [happyfuntimes](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes) games
so you can tell users to go to `happyfuntimes.net` which is much easier then telling them to type in something
like `http://192.168.1.231:18679`.

Running your own you'd tell them to go to your domain like `my100playergame.com` for example.
